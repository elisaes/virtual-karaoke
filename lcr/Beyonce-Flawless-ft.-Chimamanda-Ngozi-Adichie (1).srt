00:00:31,903 --> 00:00:35,202
I know when you were le girls

10
00:00:35,302 --> 00:00:39,301

11

00:01:18,414 --> 00:01:20,813
H‚ H town town

25
00:01:20,807 --> 00:01:22,206
I am coming down

26
00:01:22,312 --> 00:01:23,611
Coming‚ coming down

27
00:01:23,703 --> 00:01:26,302
Drippin′ candy on the ground

28
00:01:26,808 --> 00:01:28,707
We teach girls to shrink themselves

29
00:01:28,815 --> 00:01:30,314
To make themselves smaller

30
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:32,299
We say to girls

31
00:01:32,319 --> 00:01:33,318
You can have ambition

32
00:01:33,404 --> 00:01:35,003
But not too much

33
00:01:35,109 --> 00:01:36,708
You should aim to be successful

34
00:01:36,814 --> 00:01:37,813
But not too successful

35
00:01:37,907 --> 00:01:40,206
Otherwise you will threaten the man.

36
00:01:40,906 --> 00:01:42,105
Because I am female

37
00:01:42,215 --> 00:01:44,814
I am expected to aspire to marriage

38
00:01:45,416 --> 00:01:47,115
I am expected to make my life choices

39
00:01:47,203 --> 00:01:48,602
Always keeping in mind that

40
00:01:48,718 --> 00:01:50,217
Marriage is the most important

41
00:01:51,519 --> 00:01:53,318
Now marriage can be a source of

42
00:01:53,410 --> 00:01:56,309
Joy and love and mutual support

43
00:01:56,405 --> 00:01:58,904
But why do we teach girls
to aspire to marriage

44
00:01:59,010 --> 00:02:00,709
And we don′t teach boys the same?

45
00:02:00,815 --> 00:02:03,214
We raise girls to see each
other as competitors

46
00:02:03,316 --> 00:02:05,215
Not for jobs or for accomplishments

47
00:02:05,211 --> 00:02:06,610
Which I think can be a good thing

48
00:02:06,700 --> 00:02:08,399
But for the attention of men

49
00:02:09,411 --> 00:02:12,210
We teach girls that they cannot
be sexual beings

50
00:02:12,312 --> 00:02:14,511
In the way that boys are

51
00:02:14,513 --> 00:02:17,312
Feminist: the person who
believes in the social

52
00:02:17,406 --> 00:02:21,205
Political‚ and economic
equality of the sexes

53
00:02:21,417 --> 00:02:23,416
You wake up‚ flawless

54
00:02:23,516 --> 00:02:25,015

God damn‚ God damn‚ God damn

00:03:03,709 --> 00:03:05,208
Momma taught me good home training

72
00:03:05,314 --> 00:03:06,913
My Daddy taught me how
to love my haters

73
00:03:07,015 --> 00:03:08,714
My sister told me I should
speak my mind

74
00:03:08,806 --> 00:03:10,455
My man made me feel so God damn
